## 📝 How it works
*WIP*

## ❤️‍🔥 Our commitments
Ankit is committed to supporting your learning by remaining free and accessible to everyone. Because it’s open-source, anyone can create their own version by forking the project.

Your privacy matters to us - no personal data or usage analytics are collected. Since Ankit’s code is open for inspection, you can trust its transparency, and if you prefer, run your own Ankit web instance offline (see the `▶️ Running Locally` section for details).

We want you to feel empowered to tailor Ankit to your unique needs. All feedback, suggestions, issues, and contributions are warmly welcomed and appreciated!
